Summary:
Hotel industry is a very volatile industry and the bookings depend on variety of factors such as
type of hotels, seasonality, days of week and many more. This makes analyzing the patterns
available in the past data very important to help the hotels plan well. Using the historical data,
hotels can perform various campaigns to boost the business.
The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes
information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies,
and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. From it, we can understand
the customer’s’ behavior and it might help us make better decisions.
The process of our analysis will be by the following step: Understanding the Datasets, Data
preparation, Data Cleaning, Define our Business question, analyze the data, and visualize the
data, conclusion and insights drawn.
We have analyzed some key metrics for hotel bookings like :
• The number of cancellations
• Most preferred hotel
• Busiest month of the hotel
• Number of nights stays by guest on weekday vs. weekends
• Most affected meal on cancellation of bookings
• Highest bookings market segment
• Year-wise bookings of the hotel
• Booking types(family , couples , single)
• Room price vary per night over the year
• Hotels available for booking
In this project, we have analyzed the busiest or most occupied month by customers and
we concluded that August is the busiest month which is having highest number of
bookings and January has least no. of bookings. We have further analyzed that City
hotel have more no. of cancelled bookings and having highest no. of bookings. Also,
Online TA is the most preferred booking segment. We have tried using the data available to
analyze the factors affecting the hotel bookings. These factors can be used for reporting the
trends and predict the future bookings.
